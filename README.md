# Mathematica notebook for computing the BRST cohomology and brackets of a deformed 4d βγ system
- General symbolic manipulation for the 4d βγ system built it
- Computes the semi-chiral ring (BRST cohomology computation in the βγ system)
- Computes the lambda-2-bracket
- Computes the loop-corrected regularized product
- Has an experimental implementation of a calculation of the lambda-3-bracket
- With worked examples
