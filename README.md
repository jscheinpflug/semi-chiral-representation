# Mathematica notebook for computing the semi-chiral ring and brackets of a deformed 4d beta gamma system
- General symbolic manipulation for the 4d beta gamma system built it
- Computes the semi-chiral ring (cohomology computation)
- Computes the lambda-2-bracket
- Computes the loop-corrected regularized product
- Has an experimental implementation of a calculation of a lambda-3-bracket
- With worked examples
